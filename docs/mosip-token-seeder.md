# MOSIP Token Seeder



## Initial Thoughts

* We are addressing one of the last mile problems
* Token seeding - main function
* KYC fields in the form automatically populated
* Additional fields related to scheme may be present
* Seeder is agnostic to a scheme/registry/form as long as mandatory KYC fields are present.
* All the fields are forwarded to the department via Websub with attached MOSIP auth token.
* Auth failure handled â€” error message sent to Dept using the same Websub mechanism
* Data at rest (in WebSub) encoded using public key of subscribed department (like partner management in MOSIP).
* No persistence of PII data

## Octopus Model Architecture

A multi-point system which can cater any type of input and output to make the MOSIP Token Seeder effective in any possible use cases.

### Inputs

1. Direct Plain KYC Request
2. CSV Upload
3. ODK based upload
4. JSON Array Upload
5. Google Sheets upload
6. Form.IO Sheets upload
7. VC

### Outputs

1. Direct Synchronous Response
2. CSV
3. JSON

### Delivery Method

1. Synchronous Response
2. WebSub
3. SFTP
4. Download URL

### Design Considerations/Open Questions

* **Secrets Management** - Save the credentials for SFTP/ODK etc.
* **Status management** - Various status of a token seeding request. (Uploaded/Processing/Completed/Archived)
* **Database** - Data persistence for the whole system
* **Processed CSV/JSON** - How do we persist the csv/json for which token generation is completed.
* **VC** - Should we be verifying the Digital Signature
* **VC** - Shouldn't we define a output fields?
* **Biometric inputs** - Should we consider Biometric inputs for the authentication?
* **Scheduled Jobs** - Repeated tasks can be configured through a API call (for instance, Daily ODK Pull)
* **Status Check** - API for querying on the status of a token seeding request.
* **MOSIP Authentication Fields** - API to fetch the list of MOSIP Authentication fields so that a mapper configuration can be generated to make CSV/JSON token seeder request.   &#x20;
